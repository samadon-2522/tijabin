     Many variations on the supermarket began appearing toward the end of the 1900s.
         Today warehouse stores sell recognized brands at lower prices, 
        often cutting costs by selling groceries directly out of 
        the shipping cartons in a no-frills warehouselike setting.
         Convenience stores, often attached to a gasoline station,
         offer snack foods, dairy items, and notions. Wholesale club stores
         such as Costco or Sam’s Club specialize in selling bulk quantities to club members
         at deeply discounted prices. Club stores usually charge annual membership fees.
